#Internship Project: Running vs. Walking Classification Project
# Problem Statement
This project aims to classify physical activities as either running or walking based on various predictor variables, which may include sensor data such as accelerometer or gyroscope readings. Accurate classification of these activities is valuable for health and fitness tracking applications, offering users insights into their activity patterns.

# Objectives
Data Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand patterns and differences in the dataset for running vs. walking activities.
Predictive Modeling: Develop a machine learning model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to classify each activity.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using accuracy and other classification metrics to ensure reliable predictions.
# Tasks
# Task 1: Data Analysis
Complete an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions, feature importance, and any preprocessing needs.
Visualize patterns in the data that differentiate running from walking.
# Task 2: Predictive Modeling
Build and fine-tune an LSTM model to classify activities as running or walking.
Evaluate model performance and refine it as needed to improve classification accuracy.
# Dataset Overview
The dataset contains time-series data with features capturing physical movement, likely including:

Accelerometer Data: Indicates the intensity of movement.
Gyroscope Data: Captures rotational movements.
Other Sequential Data: Temporal data capturing gait patterns or additional physical activity indicators.
# The target variable (y) is binary:

0: Walking
1: Running
Conclusion
By developing a model to classify activities based on time-series data, this project can contribute to more accurate tracking in fitness and health monitoring systems. This model could help improve personalized health insights and support wellness goals through reliable activity recognition.
